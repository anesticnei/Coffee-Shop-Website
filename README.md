# Fresh and Clean Coffee Shop Website

I created a fresh and clean coffee shop website that is both functional and visually appealing. This non-commercial project features a newsletter subscription popup that appears asynchronously a few seconds after the page loads, a preloader to enhance the user experience, and a contact form that allows customers to send emails.

The website also includes a gallery showcasing the coffee shop, a menu section that is easy to navigate, and a section for customers to inquire about hosting events.
